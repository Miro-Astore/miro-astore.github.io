abstract = {Protein oxidation sits at the intersection of multiple signalling pathways, yet the magnitude and extent of crosstalk between oxidation and other post-translational modifications remains unclear. Here, we delineate global changes in adipocyte signalling networks following acute oxidative stress and reveal considerable crosstalk between cysteine oxidation and phosphorylation-based signalling. Oxidation of key regulatory kinases, including Akt, mTOR and AMPK influences the fidelity rather than their absolute activation state, highlighting an unappreciated interplay between these modifications. Mechanistic analysis of the redox regulation of Akt identified two cysteine residues in the pleckstrin homology domain (C60 and C77) to be reversibly oxidized. Oxidation at these sites affected Akt recruitment to the plasma membrane by stabilizing the PIP3 binding pocket. Our data provide insights into the interplay between oxidative stress-derived redox signalling and protein phosphorylation networks and serve as a resource for understanding the contribution of cellular oxidation to a range of diseases.},

@article{Wong2021,
abstract = {A significant challenge to making targeted CFTR modulator therapies accessible to all individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are many mutations in the CFTR gene that can cause CF, most of which remain uncharacterized. Here, we characterized the structural and functional defects of the rare CFTR mutation R352Q – with potential role contributing to intrapore chloride ion permeation – in patient-derived cell models of the airway and gut. CFTR function in differentiated nasal epithelial cultures and matched intestinal organoids was assessed using ion transport assay and forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay respectively. Two CFTR potentiators (VX-770, GLPG1837) and a corrector (VX-809) were tested. Data from R352Q-CFTR were compared to that of participants with mutations with known impact on CFTR function. R352Q-CFTR has residual CFTR function which was restored to functional CFTR activity by CFTR potentiators but not the corrector. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of R352Q-CFTR were carried out which indicated the presence of a chloride conductance defect, with little evidence supporting a gating defect. The combination approach of in vitro patient-derived cell models and in silico MD simulations to characterize rare CFTR mutations can improve the specificity and sensitivity of modulator response predictions and aid in their translational use for CF precision medicine.
